# Twittyle

> Twitter styles because it's driving me batshit. Made with love and anxiety in July 2019.

This version of twitter is very hard to override, so this thing is really particular to my tastes. You'll get the best results if you're using dim mode with pink (go into the more section of the left sidebar, click display, check DIM and pink).

If you don't want pink, no problem! You might want to fork this and change line 90 of `override.css` to the color of your choice. That's really the only thing that's pink.

_This isn't a fancy schmancy project. I really just wanted to fix twitter so I could read it again, and a few other people asked if they could use it too. I made this in about 4 hours, I don't have time to maintain it. I'm not really accepting feature requests. You can always ask! Just setting expectations here. You can totally fork this and make it your own, though! Cheers üçª_
