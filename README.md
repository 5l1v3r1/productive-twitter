# Twittyle

Twitter styles because it's driving me batshit. Made with love and anxiety.

This version of twitter is very hard to override, so this thing is really particular to my tastes. You'll get the best results if you're using dim mode with pink (go into the more section of the left sidebar, click display, check DIM and pink).

If you don't want pink, no problem! You might want to fork this and change line 90 to the color of your choice.
